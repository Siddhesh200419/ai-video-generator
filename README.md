## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Topic Input**: You provide a topic (e.g., "The History of Mars", "Scary Campfire Story").
2.  **Script Creation**: The AI generates a structured script with scenes and dialogue.
3.  **Media Generation**:
    -   Voiceover audio is generated from the script.
    -   Visual prompts are created and sent to the image generation API.
    -   Captions are extracted from the audio.
4.  **Assembly**: The **Remotion** engine combines the audio, images, and captions into a single MP4 video file.
5.  **Result**: You can preview and download the final video.
